# Customize-Android-Apps
This contains my notes on how to customize existing Android apps such as changing app name, app icon, hiding app from the app drawer, and others. These steps were done on a Windows PC.

# Preparation
The first step to customize an Android app is of course to download the `.apk` file:
1. Search your desired app to customize in [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps).
2. Copy the link of the app from Google Play to this [apk downlaoder site](https://apps.evozi.com/apk-downloader/). For the purpose of this demonstration, I will customize [AnyDesk Remote Desktop](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anydesk.anydeskandroid). Below shows the downloaded `.apk` file.
